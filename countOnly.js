/*
countOnly will be given an array and an object.

It will return an object containing counts of everything that the input object listed.

Rules:
only keys which have a truthy value should be counted in the resulting object.

All other strings (either set to false or not included at all in the object) should NOT be counted.

if a particular string is meant to be counted => true , include it.

if particular string meant to be count but doesn't existed in input array, do NOT include in final count.
